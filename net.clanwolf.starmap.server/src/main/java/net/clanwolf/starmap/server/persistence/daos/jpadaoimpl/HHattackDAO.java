 *  W-7 is the production facility of Clan Wolf. The home base is   |
 *  Tranquil, but there are several mobile departments. In the      |
 *  development department there is a small group of developers and |
 *  designers busy to field new software products for battlefield   |
 *  commanders as well as for strategic dimensions of the clans     |
 *  operations. The department is led by a experienced StarColonel  |
 *  who fell out of active duty due to a wound he suffered during   |
 *  the battle on Tukkayid. His name and dossier are classified,    |
 *  get in contact through regular chain of command.                |
 *                                                                  |

 *  One of the products used to control the production and the      |

 *  "Communication - Command - Control".                            |
 *  Because there is a field based system to control the            |
 *  communication and data transfer of Mechs, this system is often  |
 *  refered to as "Big C3", however, the official name is           |
 *  "W-7 C3 / MkIII 'Damien'".                                      |
