C3 version history
[ https://www.clanwolf.net | https://github.com/ClanWolf ]
----------------------------------------------------------------

TODO PRIO 1 - Immediate:
- *** Finish refactoring of Diplomacy
- *** Only one alliance is allowed for each faction at a time
- Change compression level of jlink as soon as moditect supports the new param
- If an attack is lost, the jumpship is moved back to the system it came from
- Check diplomacy on planet attacks and routepoints (already effective?)
- Allow allied pilots to be droplead in fights for allied factions
- Allied faction leader should see the jump route of allied jumpships
- If user logs out and another logs in without closing the client, not all user related data is adapted to the new user
- Check if a player changed mech chassis in the middle of an invasion and set drop to be lost for that side
- If attack teams are invalid (e.g. one pilot switched sides,...), kick everyone out of the attack and force a new lobby (ResultAnalyzer.java, L.195)

TODO PRIO 2 - Medium:
- Add keyboard shortcuts for language change and help and open attack forum post
- Userlist needs one more column on what side the char fights
- Userlist needs one more column to display what role (e.g. droplead) the char has
- Add global keys to the GUI (to control the client by hotkeys while there is no focus)
- Check tab order and keyboard control for all panes
- Delete user in admin pane (?)
- Finish sound samples on the radio buttons (R1-3) on Invasionpane
- Auto-delete not activated user
- Sound volume and Speech volume vs RP volume cleanup
- Insert discord thread for each attack automatically
- Add a function to leave game / delete account
- Channel message (discord) if a user successfully changes faction
- MWO API Loop is still active after the end of an invasion

TODO PRIO 3 - Long term:
- Updating the manual (ongoing): https://www.clanwolf.net/apps/C3/C3_Manual_de.pdf
- Web-View of the Starmap
- Waiting circle animation is off-center
- Banner at the End of an invasion for each faction
- Error message for double login to correct error message
- Rename Threads in Clan Wolf Forum and discord announcement to pattern: CGB ⚔ Odabasi (DC)
- List of faction key, where each burns at usetime (one-time faction key)
- Sometimes the hourglass in invasionpane does not disappear after confirming result
- After publish was clicked in MWO, remind to confirm winner in app (!)

----------------------------------------------------------------

WATCH OUT FOR WHILE TESTING:
- MAYBE FIXED: Players can still join fights when video runs
- MAYBE FIXED: Video does not show sometimes
- People in the Lobby can only be moved by the dropleads
- Video is playing as intro of an invasion, stops as soon as lobby owner starts the invasion ('Next' button)
- Join buttons (invasion lobby) is correctly disabled after the fights startet / Intro is running
- Wrong tab order of buttons and controls (anywhere)
- Wrong statements in the manual (things might have changed and the manual becomes outdated sometimes)
- Any exceptions or errors (ERROR or SEVERE) in the log. Warnings might be interesting, but probably not urgent
