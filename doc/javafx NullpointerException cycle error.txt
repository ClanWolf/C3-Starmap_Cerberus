If the application becomes unresponsive and throwing nullpointer exceptions from a renderer instance, it needs more
memory allocated.

To do that workaround, add a JVM parameter:
-Dprism.maxvram=4G (or higher)

This is to work around a javafx bug that might become solved eventually.
So, maybe this can be removed some day.
